      "Proceeding, fellow citizens, to that qualification which the Constitution requires before my entrance on the charge again conferred on me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain of this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens at large, and the zeal with which it inspires me so to conduct myself as may best satisfy their just expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "On taking this station on a former occasion I declared the principles on which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs of our Commonwealth. MY conscience tells me I have on every occasion acted up to that declaration according to its obvious import and to the understanding of every candid mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the transaction of your foreign affairs we have endeavored to cultivate the friendship of all nations, and especially of those with which we have the most important relations. We have done them justice on all occasions, favored where favor was lawful, and cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and equal terms. We are firmly convinced, and we act on that conviction, that with nations as with individuals our interests soundly calculated will ever be found inseparable from our moral duties, and history bears witness to the fact that a just nation is trusted on its word when recourse is had to armaments and wars to bridle others.\n",
      "\n",
      "At home, fellow citizens, you best know whether we have done well or ill. The suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless establishments and expenses, enabled us to discontinue our internal taxes. These, covering our land with officers and opening our doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process of domiciliary vexation which once entered is scarcely to be restrained from reaching successively every article of property and produce. If among these taxes some minor ones fell which had not been inconvenient, it was because their amount would not have paid the officers who collected them, and because, if they had any merit, the State authorities might adopt them instead of others less approved.\n",
      "\n",
      "The remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles is paid chiefly by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries to domestic comforts, being collected on our seaboard and frontiers only, and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile citizens, it may be the pleasure and the pride of an American to ask, What farmer, what mechanic, what laborer ever sees a taxgatherer of the United States? These contributions enable us to support the current expenses of the Government, to fulfill contracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the native right of soil within our limits, to extend those limits, and to apply such a surplus to our public debts as places at a short day their final redemption, and that redemption once effected the revenue thereby liberated may, by a just repartition of it among the States and a corresponding amendment of the Constitution, be applied in time of peace to rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education, and other great objects within each State. In time of war, if injustice by ourselves or others must sometimes produce war, increased as the same revenue will be by increased population and consumption, and aided by other resources reserved for that crisis, it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year without encroaching on the rights of future generations by burthening them with the debts of the past. War will then be but a suspension of useful works, and a return to a state of peace, a return to the progress of improvement.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have said, fellow citizens, that the income reserved had enabled us to extend our limits, but that extension may possibly pay for itself before we are called on, and in the meantime may keep down the accruing interest; in all events, it will replace the advances we shall have made. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana had been disapproved by some from a candid apprehension that the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union. But who can limit the extent to which the federative principle may operate effectively? The larger our association the less will it be shaken by local passions; and in any view is it not better that the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by our own brethren and children than by strangers of another family? With which should we be most likely to live in harmony and friendly intercourse?\n",
      "\n",
      "In matters of religion I have considered that its free exercise is placed by the Constitution independent of the powers of the General Government. I have therefore undertaken on no occasion to prescribe the religious exercises suited to it, but have left them, as the Constitution found them, under the direction and discipline of the church or state authorities acknowledged by the several religious societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded with the commiseration their history inspires. Endowed with the faculties and the rights of men, breathing an ardent love of liberty and independence, and occupying a country which left them no desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing population from other regions directed itself on these shores; without power to divert or habits to contend against it, they have been overwhelmed by the current or driven before it; now reduced within limits too narrow for the hunter's state, humanity enjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to encourage them to that industry which alone can enable them to maintain their place in existence and to prepare them in time for that state of society which to bodily comforts adds the improvement of the mind and morals. We have therefore liberally furnished them with the implements of husbandry and household use; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of first necessity, and they are covered with the aegis of the law against aggressors from among ourselves.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits their present course of life, to induce them to exercise their reason, follow its dictates, and change their pursuits with the change of circumstances have powerful obstacles to encounter; they are combated by the habits of their bodies, prejudices of their minds, ignorance, pride, and the influence of interested and crafty individuals among them who feel themselves something in the present order of things and fear to become nothing in any other. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for the customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did must be done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance under its counsel in their physical, moral, or political condition is perilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as their Creator made them, ignorance being safety and knowledge full of danger; in short, my friends, among them also is seen the action and counteraction of good sense and of bigotry; they too have their antiphilosophists who find an interest in keeping things in their present state, who dread reformation, and exert all their faculties to maintain the ascendancy of habit over the duty of improving our reason and obeying its mandates.\n",
      "\n",
      "In giving these outlines I do not mean, fellow citizens, to arrogate to myself the merit of the measures. That is due, in the first place, to the reflecting character of our citizens at large, who, by the weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen the public measures. It is due to the sound discretion with which they select from among themselves those to whom they confide the legislative duties. It is due to the zeal and wisdom of the characters thus selected, who lay the foundations of public happiness in wholesome laws, the execution of which alone remains for others, and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose patriotism has associated them with me in the executive functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "During this course of administration, and in order to disturb it, the artillery of the press has been leveled against us, charged with whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare. These abuses of an institution so important to freedom and science are deeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness and to sap its safety. They might, indeed, have been corrected by the wholesome punishments reserved to and provided by the laws of the several States against falsehood and defamation, but public duties more urgent press on the time of public servants, and the offenders have therefore been left to find their punishment in the public indignation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor was it uninteresting to the world that an experiment should be fairly and fully made, whether freedom of discussion, unaided by power, is not sufficient for the propagation and protection of truth -- whether a government conducting itself in the true spirit of its constitution, with zeal and purity, and doing no act which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness, can be written down by falsehood and defamation. The experiment has been tried; you have witnessed the scene; our fellow citizens looked on, cool and collected; they saw the latent source from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered around their public functionaries, and when the Constitution called them to the decision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict, honorable to those who had served them and consolatory to the friend of man who believes that he may be trusted with the control of his own affairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "No inference is here intended that the laws provided by the States against false and defamatory publications should not be enforced; he who has time renders a service to public morals and public tranquillity in reforming these abuses by the salutary coercions of the law; but the experiment is noted to prove that, since truth and reason have maintained their ground against false opinions in league with false facts, the press, confined to truth, needs no other legal restraint; the public judgment will correct false reasoning and opinions on a full hearing of all parties; and no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable liberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness. If there be still improprieties which this rule would not restrain, its supplement must be sought in the censorship of public opinion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally as auguring harmony and happiness to our future course, I offer to our country sincere congratulations. With those, too, not yet rallied to the same point the disposition to do so is gaining strength; facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them, and our doubting brethren will at length see that the mass of their fellow citizens with whom they can not yet resolve to act as to principles and measures, think as they think and desire what they desire; that our wish as well as theirs is that the public efforts may be directed honestly to the public good, that peace be cultivated, civil and religious liberty unassailed, law and order preserved, equality of rights maintained, and that state of property, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his own industry or that of his father's. When satisfied of these views it is not in human nature that they should not approve and support them. In the meantime let us cherish them with patient affection, let us do them justice, and more than justice, in all competitions of interest; and we need not doubt that truth, reason, and their own interests will at length prevail, will gather them into the fold of their country, and will complete that entire union of opinion which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony and the benefit of all its strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens have again called me, and shall proceed in the spirit of those principles which they have approved. I fear not that any motives of interest may lead me astray; I am sensible of no passion which could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice, but the weaknesses of human nature and the limits of my own understanding will produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to your interests. I shall need, therefore, all the indulgence which I have heretofore experienced from my constituents; the want of it will certainly not lessen with increasing years. I shall need, too, the favor of that Being in whose hands we are, who led our fathers, as Israel of old, from their native land and planted them in a country flowing with all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered our infancy with His providence and our riper years with His wisdom and power, and to whose goodness I ask you to join in supplications with me that He will so enlighten the minds of your servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures that whatsoever they do shall result in your good, and shall secure to you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.\n",

       "\"When it was first perceived, in early times, that no middle course for America remained between unlimited submission to a foreign legislature and a total independence of its claims, men of reflection were less apprehensive of danger from the formidable power of fleets and armies they must determine to resist than from those contests and dissensions which would certainly arise concerning the forms of government to be instituted over the whole and over the parts of this extensive country. Relying, however, on the purity of their intentions, the justice of their cause, and the integrity and intelligence of the people, under an overruling Providence which had so signally protected this country from the first, the representatives of this nation, then consisting of little more than half its present number, not only broke to pieces the chains which were forging and the rod of iron that was lifted up, but frankly cut asunder the ties which had bound them, and launched into an ocean of uncertainty.\\n\\nThe zeal and ardor of the people during the Revolutionary war, supplying the place of government, commanded a degree of order sufficient at least for the temporary preservation of society. The Confederation which was early felt to be necessary was prepared from the models of the Batavian and Helvetic confederacies, the only examples which remain with any detail and precision in history, and certainly the only ones which the people at large had ever considered. But reflecting on the striking difference in so many particulars between this country and those where a courier may go from the seat of government to the frontier in a single day, it was then certainly foreseen by some who assisted in Congress at the formation of it that it could not be durable.\\n\\nNegligence of its regulations, inattention to its recommendations, if not disobedience to its authority, not only in individuals but in States, soon appeared with their melancholy consequences -- universal languor, jealousies and rivalries of States, decline of navigation and commerce, discouragement of necessary manufactures, universal fall in the value of lands and their produce, contempt of public and private faith, loss of consideration and credit with foreign nations, and at length in discontents, animosities, combinations, partial conventions, and insurrection, threatening some great national calamity.\\n\\nIn this dangerous crisis the people of America were not abandoned by their usual good sense, presence of mind, resolution, or integrity. Measures were pursued to concert a plan to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty. The public disquisitions, discussions, and deliberations issued in the present happy Constitution of Government.\\n\\nEmployed in the service of my country abroad during the whole course of these transactions, I first saw the Constitution of the United States in a foreign country. Irritated by no literary altercation, animated by no public debate, heated by no party animosity, I read it with great satisfaction, as the result of good heads prompted by good hearts, as an experiment better adapted to the genius, character, situation, and relations of this nation and country than any which had ever been proposed or suggested. In its general principles and great outlines it was conformable to such a system of government as I had ever most esteemed, and in some States, my own native State in particular, had contributed to establish. Claiming a right of suffrage, in common with my fellow-citizens, in the adoption or rejection of a constitution which was to rule me and my posterity, as well as them and theirs, I did not hesitate to express my approbation of it on all occasions, in public and in private. It was not then, nor has been since, any objection to it in my mind that the Executive and Senate were not more permanent. Nor have I ever entertained a thought of promoting any alteration in it but such as the people themselves, in the course of their experience, should see and feel to be necessary or expedient, and by their representatives in Congress and the State legislatures, according to the Constitution itself, adopt and ordain.\\n\\nReturning to the bosom of my country after a painful separation from it for ten years, I had the honor to be elected to a station under the new order of things, and I have repeatedly laid myself under the most serious obligations to support the Constitution. The operation of it has equaled the most sanguine expectations of its friends, and from an habitual attention to it, satisfaction in its administration, and delight in its effects upon the peace, order, prosperity, and happiness of the nation I have acquired an habitual attachment to it and veneration for it.\\n\\nWhat other form of government, indeed, can so well deserve our esteem and love?\\n\\nThere may be little solidity in an ancient idea that congregations of men into cities and nations are the most pleasing objects in the sight of superior intelligences, but this is very certain, that to a benevolent human mind there can be no spectacle presented by any nation more pleasing, more noble, majestic, or august, than an assembly like that which has so often been seen in this and the other Chamber of Congress, of a Government in which the Executive authority, as well as that of all the branches of the Legislature, are exercised by citizens selected at regular periods by their neighbors to make and execute laws for the general good. Can anything essential, anything more than mere ornament and decoration, be added to this by robes and diamonds? Can authority be more amiable and respectable when it descends from accidents or institutions established in remote antiquity than when it springs fresh from the hearts and judgments of an honest and enlightened people? For it is the people only that are represented. It is their power and majesty that is reflected, and only for their good, in every legitimate government, under whatever form it may appear. The existence of such a government as ours for any length of time is a full proof of a general dissemination of knowledge and virtue throughout the whole body of the people. And what object or consideration more pleasing than this can be presented to the human mind? If national pride is ever justifiable or excusable it is when it springs, not from power or riches, grandeur or glory, but from conviction of national innocence, information, and benevolence.\\n\\nIn the midst of these pleasing ideas we should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, virtuous, and independent elections. If an election is to be determined by a majority of a single vote, and that can be procured by a party through artifice or corruption, the Government may be the choice of a party for its own ends, not of the nation for the national good. If that solitary suffrage can be obtained by foreign nations by flattery or menaces, by fraud or violence, by terror, intrigue, or venality, the Government may not be the choice of the American people, but of foreign nations. It may be foreign nations who govern us, and not we, the people, who govern ourselves; and candid men will acknowledge that in such cases choice would have little advantage to boast of over lot or chance.\\n\\nSuch is the amiable and interesting system of government (and such are some of the abuses to which it may be exposed) which the people of America have exhibited to the admiration and anxiety of the wise and virtuous of all nations for eight years under the administration of a citizen who, by a long course of great actions, regulated by prudence, justice, temperance, and fortitude, conducting a people inspired with the same virtues and animated with the same ardent patriotism and love of liberty to independence and peace, to increasing wealth and unexampled prosperity, has merited the gratitude of his fellow-citizens, commanded the highest praises of foreign nations, and secured immortal glory with posterity.\\n\\nIn that retirement which is his voluntary choice may he long live to enjoy the delicious recollection of his services, the gratitude of mankind, the happy fruits of them to himself and the world, which are daily increasing, and that splendid prospect of the future fortunes of this country which is opening from year to year. His name may be still a rampart, and the knowledge that he lives a bulwark, against all open or secret enemies of his country's peace. This example has been recommended to the imitation of his successors by both Houses of Congress and by the voice of the legislatures and the people throughout the nation.\\n\\nOn this subject it might become me better to be silent or to speak with diffidence; but as something may be expected, the occasion, I hope, will be admitted as an apology if I venture to say that if a preference, upon principle, of a free republican government, formed upon long and serious reflection, after a diligent and impartial inquiry after truth; if an attachment to the Constitution of the United States, and a conscientious determination to support it until it shall be altered by the judgments and wishes of the people, expressed in the mode prescribed in it; if a respectful attention to the constitutions of the individual States and a constant caution and delicacy toward the State governments; if an equal and impartial regard to the rights, interest, honor, and happiness of all the States in the Union, without preference or regard to a northern or southern, an eastern or western, position, their various political opinions on unessential points or their personal attachments; if a love of virtuous men of all parties and denominations; if a love of science and letters and a wish to patronize every rational effort to encourage schools, colleges, universities, academies, and every institution for propagating knowledge, virtue, and religion among all classes of the people, not only for their benign influence on the happiness of life in all its stages and classes, and of society in all its forms, but as the only means of preserving our Constitution from its natural enemies, the spirit of sophistry, the spirit of party, the spirit of intrigue, the profligacy of corruption, and the pestilence of foreign influence, which is the angel of destruction to elective governments; if a love of equal laws, of justice, and humanity in the interior administration; if an inclination to improve agriculture, commerce, and manufacturers for necessity, convenience, and defense; if a spirit of equity and humanity toward the aboriginal nations of America, and a disposition to meliorate their condition by inclining them to be more friendly to us, and our citizens to be more friendly to them; if an inflexible determination to maintain peace and inviolable faith with all nations, and that system of neutrality and impartiality among the belligerent powers of Europe which has been adopted by this Government and so solemnly sanctioned by both Houses of Congress and applauded by the legislatures of the States and the public opinion, until it shall be otherwise ordained by Congress; if a personal esteem for the French nation, formed in a residence of seven years chiefly among them, and a sincere desire to preserve the friendship which has been so much for the honor and interest of both nations; if, while the conscious honor and integrity of the people of America and the internal sentiment of their own power and energies must be preserved, an earnest endeavor to investigate every just cause and remove every colorable pretense of complaint; if an intention to pursue by amicable negotiation a reparation for the injuries that have been committed on the commerce of our fellow-citizens by whatever nation, and if success can not be obtained, to lay the facts before the Legislature, that they may consider what further measures the honor and interest of the Government and its constituents demand; if a resolution to do justice as far as may depend upon me, at all times and to all nations, and maintain peace, friendship, and benevolence with all the world; if an unshaken confidence in the honor, spirit, and resources of the American people, on which I have so often hazarded my all and never been deceived; if elevated ideas of the high destinies of this country and of my own duties toward it, founded on a knowledge of the moral principles and intellectual improvements of the people deeply engraven on my mind in early life, and not obscured but exalted by experience and age; and, with humble reverence, I feel it to be my duty to add, if a veneration for the religion of a people who profess and call themselves Christians, and a fixed resolution to consider a decent respect for Christianity among the best recommendations for the public service, can enable me in any degree to comply with your wishes, it shall be my strenuous endeavor that this sagacious injunction of the two Houses shall not be without effect.\\n\\nWith this great example before me, with the sense and spirit, the faith and honor, the duty and interest, of the same American people pledged to support the Constitution of the United States, I entertain no doubt of its continuance in all its energy, and my mind is prepared without hesitation to lay myself under the most solemn obligations to support it to the utmost of my power.\\n\\nAnd may that Being who is supreme over all, the Patron of Order, the Fountain of Justice, and the Protector in all ages of the world of virtuous liberty, continue His blessing upon this nation and its Government and give it all possible success and duration consistent with the ends of His providence.\\n\""

the constant effort of the execut to carri them into effect the advantag of these fortif and of an augment naval forc in the extent contempl in a point of economi ha been fulli illustr by a report of the board of engin and naval commission late commun to congress by which it appear that in an invas by 20000 men with a correspond naval forc in a campaign of six month onli the whole expens of the construct of the work would be defray by the differ in the sum necessari to maintain the forc which would be adequ to our defens with the aid of those work and that which would be incur without them the reason of thi differ is obviou if fortif are judici place on our great inlet as distant from our citi as circumst will permit they will form the onli point of attack and the enemi will be detain there by a small regular forc a suffici time to enabl our militia to collect and repair to that on which the attack is made a forc adequ to the enemi collect at that singl point with suitabl prepar for such other as might be menac is all that would be requisit but if there were no fortif then the enemi might go where he pleas and chang hi posit and sail from place to place our forc must be call out and spread in vast number along the whole coast and on both side of everi bay and river as high up in each as it might be navig for ship of war by these fortif support by our navi to which they

       " 'call from a retir which i had suppos wa to continu for the residu of my life to fill the chief execut offic of thi great and free nation i appear befor you fellow citizen to take the oath which the constitut prescrib as a necessari qualif for the perform of it duti and in obedi to a custom coeval with our govern and what i believ to be your expect i proceed to present to you a summari of the principl which will govern me in the discharg of the duti which i shall be call upon to perform it wa the remark of a roman consul in an earli period of that celebr republ that a most strike contrast wa observ in the conduct of candid for offic of power and trust befor and after obtain them they seldom carri out in the latter case the pledg and promis made in the former howev much the world may have improv in mani respect in the laps of upward of two thousand year sinc the remark wa made by the virtuou and indign roman i fear that a strict examin of the annal of some of the modern elect govern would develop similar instanc of violat confid although the fiat of the peopl ha gone forth proclaim me the chief magistr of thi gloriou union noth upon their part remain to be done it may be thought that a motiv may exist to keep up the delus under which they may be suppos to have act in relat to my principl and opinion and perhap there may be some in thi assembl who have come here either prepar to condemn those i shall now deliv or approv them to doubt the sincer with which they are now utter but the laps of a few month will confirm or dispel their fear the outlin of principl to govern and measur to be adopt by an administr not yet begun will soon be exchang for immut histori and i shall stand either exoner by my countrymen or class with the mass of those who promis that they might deceiv and flatter with the intent to betray howev strong may be my present purpos to realiz the expect of a magnanim and confid peopl i too well understand the danger temptat to which i shall be expos from the magnitud of the power which it ha been the pleasur of the peopl to commit to my hand not to place my chief confid upon the aid of that almighti power which ha hitherto protect me and enabl me to bring to favor issu other import but still greatli inferior trust heretofor confid to me by my countri the broad foundat upon which our constitut rest be the peopl a breath of their have made as a breath can unmak chang or modifi it it can be assign to none of the great divis of govern but to that of democraci if such is it theori those who are call upon to administ it must recogn as it lead principl the duti of shape their measur so as to produc the greatest good to the greatest number but with these broad admiss if we would compar the sovereignti acknowledg to exist in the mass of our peopl with the power claim by other sovereignti even by those which have been consid most pure democrat we shall find a most essenti differ all other lay claim to power limit onli by their own will the major of our citizen on the contrari possess a sovereignti with an amount of power precis equal to that which ha been grant to them by the parti to the nation compact and noth beyond we admit of no govern by divin right believ that so far as power is concern the benefic creator ha made no distinct amongst men that all are upon an equal and that the onli legitim right to govern is an express grant of power from the govern the constitut of the unit state is the instrument contain thi grant of power to the sever depart compos the govern on an examin of that instrument it will be found to contain declar of power grant and of power withheld the latter is also suscept of divis into power which the major had the right to grant but which they do not think proper to intrust to their agent and that which they could not have grant not be possess by themselv in other word there are certain right possess by each individu american citizen which in hi compact with the other he ha never surrend some of them inde he is unabl to surrend be in the languag of our system unalien the boast privileg of a roman citizen wa to him a shield onli against a petti provinci ruler whilst the proud democrat of athen would consol himself under a sentenc of death for a suppos violat of the nation faith which no one understood and which at time wa the subject of the mockeri of all or the banish from hi home hi famili and hi countri with or without an alleg caus that it wa the act not of a singl tyrant or hate aristocraci but of hi assembl countrymen far differ is the power of our sovereignti it can interfer with no one faith prescrib form of worship for no one observ inflict no punish but after well ascertain guilt the result of investig under rule prescrib by the constitut itself these preciou privileg and those scarc less import of give express to hi thought and opinion either by write or speak unrestrain but by the liabil for injuri to other and that of a full particip in all the advantag which flow from the govern the acknowledg properti of all the american citizen deriv from no charter grant by hi fellow man he claim them becaus he is himself a man fashion by the same almighti hand as the rest of hi speci and entitl to a full share of the bless with which he ha endow them notwithstand the limit sovereignti possess by the peopl of the unit stage and the restrict grant of power to the govern which they have adopt enough ha been given to accomplish all the object for which it wa creat it ha been found power in war and hitherto justic ha been administ and intim union effect domest tranquil preserv and person liberti secur to the citizen as wa to be expect howev from the defect of languag and the necessarili sententi manner in which the constitut is written disput have arisen as to the amount of power which it ha actual grant or wa intend to grant thi is more particularli the case in relat to that part of the instrument which treat of the legisl branch and not onli as regard the exercis of power claim under a gener claus give that bodi the author to pass all law necessari to carri into effect the specifi power but in relat to the latter also it is howev consolatori to reflect that most of the instanc of alleg departur from the letter or spirit of the constitut have ultim receiv the sanction of a major of the peopl and the fact that mani of our statesmen most distinguish for talent and patriot have been at one time or other of their polit career on both side of each of the most warmli disput question forc upon us the infer that the error if error there were are attribut to the intrins difficulti in mani instanc of ascertain the intent of the framer of the constitut rather than the influenc of ani sinist or unpatriot motiv but the great danger to our institut doe not appear to me to be in a usurp by the govern of power not grant by the peopl but by the accumul in one of the depart of that which wa assign to other limit as are the power which have been grant still enough have been grant to constitut a despot if concentr in one of the depart thi danger is greatli heighten as it ha been alway observ that men are less jealou of encroach of one depart upon anoth than upon their own reserv right when the constitut of the unit state first came from the hand of the convent which form it mani of the sternest republican of the day were alarm at the extent of the power which had been grant to the feder govern and more particularli of that portion which had been assign to the execut branch there were in it featur which appear not to be in harmoni with their idea of a simpl repres democraci or republ and know the tendenc of power to increas itself particularli when exercis by a singl individu predict were made that at no veri remot period the govern would termin in virtual monarchi it would not becom me to say that the fear of these patriot have been alreadi realiz but as i sincer believ that the tendenc of measur and of men opinion for some year past ha been in that direct it is i conceiv strictli proper that i should take thi occas to repeat the assur i have heretofor given of my determin to arrest the progress of that tendenc if it realli exist and restor the govern to it pristin health and vigor as far as thi can be effect by ani legitim exercis of the power place in my hand i proceed to state in as summari a manner as i can my opinion of the sourc of the evil which have been so extens complain of and the correct which may be appli some of the former are unquestion to be found in the defect of the constitut other in my judgment are attribut to a misconstruct of some of it provis of the former is the elig of the same individu to a second term of the presid the sagaci mind of mr jefferson earli saw and lament thi error and attempt have been made hitherto without success to appli the amendatori power of the state to it correct as howev one mode of correct is in the power of everi presid and consequ in mine it would be useless and perhap invidi to enumer the evil of which in the opinion of mani of our fellow citizen thi error of the sage who frame the constitut may have been the sourc and the bitter fruit which we are still to gather from it if it continu to disfigur our system it may be observ howev as a gener remark that republ can commit no greater error than to adopt or continu ani featur in their system of govern which may be calcul to creat or increas the lover of power in the bosom of those to whom necess oblig them to commit the manag of their affair and sure noth is more like to produc such a state of mind than the long continu of an offic of high trust noth can be more corrupt noth more destruct of all those nobl feel which belong to the charact of a devot republican patriot when thi corrupt passion onc take possess of the human mind like the love of gold it becom insati it is the never die worm in hi bosom grow with hi growth and strengthen with the declin year of it victim if thi is true it is the part of wisdom for a republ to limit the servic of that offic at least to whom she ha intrust the manag of her foreign relat the execut of her law and the command of her armi and navi to a period so short as to prevent hi forget that he is the account agent not the princip the servant not the master until an amend of the constitut can be effect public opinion may secur the desir object i give my aid to it by renew the pledg heretofor given that under no circumst will i consent to serv a second term but if there is danger to public liberti from the acknowledg defect of the constitut in the want of limit to the continu of the execut power in the same hand there is i apprehend not much less from a misconstruct of that instrument as it regard the power actual given i can not conceiv that by a fair construct ani or either of it provis would be found to constitut the presid a part of the legisl power it can not be claim from the power to recommend sinc although enjoin as a duti upon him it is a privileg which he hold in common with everi other citizen and although there may be someth more of confid in the proprieti of the measur recommend in the one case than in the other in the oblig of ultim decis there can be no differ in the languag of the constitut all the legisl power which it grant are vest in the congress of the unit state it would be a solec in languag to say that ani portion of these is not includ in the whole it may be said inde that the constitut ha given to the execut the power to annul the act of the legisl bodi by refus to them hi assent so a similar power ha necessarili result from that instrument to the judiciari and yet the judiciari form no part of the legislatur there is it is true thi differ between these grant of power the execut can put hi neg upon the act of the legislatur for other caus than that of want of conform to the constitut whilst the judiciari can onli declar void those which violat that instrument but the decis of the judiciari is final in such a case wherea in everi instanc where the veto of the execut is appli it may be overcom by a vote of two third of both hous of congress the neg upon the act of the legisl by the execut author and that in the hand of one individu would seem to be an incongru in our system like some other of a similar charact howev it appear to be highli expedi and if use onli with the forbear and in the spirit which wa intend by it author it may be product of great good and be found one of the best safeguard to the union at the period of the format of the constitut the principl doe not appear to have enjoy much favor in the state govern it exist but in two and in one of these there wa a plural execut if we would search for the motiv which oper upon the pure patriot and enlighten assembl which frame the constitut for the adopt of a provis so appar repugn to the lead democrat principl that the major should govern we must reject the idea that they anticip from it ani benefit to the ordinari cours of legisl they knew too well the high degre of intellig which exist among the peopl and the enlighten charact of the state legislatur not to have the fullest confid that the two bodi elect by them would be worthi repres of such constitu and of cours that they would requir no aid in conceiv and matur the measur which the circumst of the countri might requir and it is preposter to suppos that a thought could for a moment have been entertain that the presid place at the capit in the center of the countri could better understand the want and wish of the peopl than their own immedi repres who spend a part of everi year among them live with them often labor with them and bound to them by the tripl tie of interest duti and affect to assist or control congress then in it ordinari legisl could not i conceiv have been the motiv for confer the veto power on the presid thi argument acquir addit forc from the fact of it never have been thu use by the first six presid and two of them were member of the convent one presid over it deliber and the other bear a larger share in consumm the labor of that august bodi than ani other person but if bill were never return to congress by either of the presid abov refer to upon the ground of their be inexpedi or not as well adapt as they might be to the want of the peopl the veto wa appli upon that of want of conform to the constitut or becaus error had been commit from a too hasti enact there is anoth ground for the adopt of the veto principl which had probabl more influenc in recommend it to the convent than ani other i refer to the secur which it give to the just and equit action of the legislatur upon all part of the union it could not but have occur to the convent that in a countri so extens embrac so great a varieti of soil and climat and consequ of product and which from the same caus must ever exhibit a great differ in the amount of the popul of it variou section call for a great divers in the employ of the peopl that the legisl of the major might not alway justli regard the right and interest of the minor and that act of thi charact might be pass under an express grant by the word of the constitut and therefor not within the compet of the judiciari to declar void that howev enlighten and patriot they might suppos from past experi the member of congress might be and howev larg partak in the gener of the liber feel of the peopl it wa imposs to expect that bodi so constitut should not sometim be control by local interest and section feel it wa proper therefor to provid some umpir from whose situat and mode of appoint more independ and freedom from such influenc might be expect such a one wa afford by the execut depart constitut by the constitut a person elect to that high offic have hi constitu in everi section state and subdivis of the union must consid himself bound by the most solemn sanction to guard protect and defend the right of all and of everi portion great or small from the injustic and oppress of the rest i consid the veto power therefor given by the constitut to the execut of the unit state sole as a conserv power to be use onli first to protect the constitut from violat secondli the peopl from the effect of hasti legisl where their will ha been probabl disregard or not well understood and thirdli to prevent the effect of combin viol of the right of minor in refer to the second of these object i may observ that i consid it the right and privileg of the peopl to decid disput point of the constitut aris from the gener grant of power to congress to carri into effect the power expressli given and i believ with mr madison that repeat recognit under vari circumst in act of the legisl execut and judici branch of the govern accompani by indic in differ mode of the concurr of the gener will of the nation as afford to the presid suffici author for hi consid such disput point as settl upward of half a centuri ha elaps sinc the adopt of the present form of govern it would be an object more highli desir than the gratif of the curios of specul statesmen if it precis situat could be ascertain a fair exhibit made of the oper of each of it depart of the power which they respect claim and exercis of the collis which have occur between them or between the whole govern and those of the state or either of them we could then compar our actual condit after fifti year trial of our system with what it wa in the commenc of it oper and ascertain whether the predict of the patriot who oppos it adopt or the confid hope of it advoc have been best realiz the great dread of the former seem to have been that the reserv power of the state would be absorb by those of the feder govern and a consolid power establish leav to the state the shadow onli of that independ action for which they had so zealous contend and on the preserv of which they reli as the last hope of liberti without deni that the result to which they look with so much apprehens is in the way of be realiz it is obviou that they did not clearli see the mode of it accomplish the gener govern ha seiz upon none of the reserv right of the state as far as ani open warfar may have gone the state author have ampli maintain their right to a casual observ our system present no appear of discord between the differ member which compos it even the addit of mani new one ha produc no jar they move in their respect orbit in perfect harmoni with the central head and with each other but there is still an undercurr at work by which if not season check the worst apprehens of our antifeder patriot will be realiz and not onli will the state author be overshadow by the great increas of power in the execut depart of the gener govern but the charact of that govern if not it design be essenti and radic chang thi state of thing ha been in part effect by caus inher in the constitut and in part by the never fail tendenc of polit power to increas itself by make the presid the sole distribut of all the patronag of the govern the framer of the constitut do not appear to have anticip at how short a period it would becom a formid instrument to control the free oper of the state govern of trifl import at first it had earli in mr jefferson administr becom so power as to creat great alarm in the mind of that patriot from the potent influenc it might exert in control the freedom of the elect franchis if such could have then been the effect of it influenc how much greater must be the danger at thi time quadrupl in amount as it certainli is and more complet under the control of the execut will than their construct of their power allow or the forbear charact of all the earli presid permit them to make but it is not by the extent of it patronag alon that the execut depart ha becom danger but by the use which it appear may be made of the appoint power to bring under it control the whole revenu of the countri the constitut ha declar it to be the duti of the presid to see that the law are execut and it make him the command in chief of the armi and navi of the unit state if the opinion of the most approv writer upon that speci of mix govern which in modern europ is term monarchi in contradistinct to despot is correct there wa want no other addit to the power of our chief magistr to stamp a monarch charact on our govern but the control of the public financ and to me it appear strang inde that anyon should doubt that the entir control which the presid possess over the offic who have the custodi of the public money by the power of remov with or without caus doe for all mischiev purpos at least virtual subject the treasur also to hi dispos the first roman emperor in hi attempt to seiz the sacr treasur silenc the opposit of the offic to whose charg it had been commit by a signific allus to hi sword by a select of polit instrument for the care of the public money a refer to their commiss by a presid would be quit as effectu an argument as that of caesar to the roman knight i am not insens of the great difficulti that exist in draw a proper plan for the safe keep and disburs of the public revenu and i know the import which ha been attach by men of great abil and patriot to the divorc as it is call of the treasuri from the bank institut it is not the divorc which is complain of but the unhallow union of the treasuri with the execut depart which ha creat such extens alarm to thi danger to our republican institut and that creat by the influenc given to the execut through the instrument of the feder offic i propos to appli all the remedi which may be at my command it wa certainli a great error in the framer of the constitut not to have made the offic at the head of the treasuri depart entir independ of the execut he should at least have been remov onli upon the demand of the popular branch of the legislatur i have determin never to remov a secretari of the treasuri without commun all the circumst attend such remov to both hous of congress the influenc of the execut in control the freedom of the elect franchis through the medium of the public offic can be effectu check by renew the prohibit publish by mr jefferson forbid their interfer in elect further than give their own vote and their own independ secur by an assur of perfect immun in exercis thi sacr privileg of freemen under the dictat of their own unbias judgment never with my consent shall an offic of the peopl compens for hi servic out of their pocket becom the pliant instrument of execut will there is no part of the mean place in the hand of the execut which might be use with greater effect for unhallow purpos than the control of the public press the maxim which our ancestor deriv from the mother countri that the freedom of the press is the great bulwark of civil and religi liberti is one of the most preciou legaci which they have left us we have learn too from our own as well as the experi of other countri that golden shackl by whomsoev or by whatev pretens impos are as fatal to it as the iron bond of despot the press in the necessari employ of the govern should never be use to clear the guilti or to varnish crime a decent and manli examin of the act of the govern should be not onli toler but encourag upon anoth occas i have given my opinion at some length upon the improprieti of execut interfer in the legisl of congress that the articl in the constitut make it the duti of the presid to commun inform and author him to recommend measur wa not intend to make him the sourc in legisl and in particular that he should never be look to for scheme of financ it would be veri strang inde that the constitut should have strictli forbidden one branch of the legislatur from interf in the origin of such bill and that it should be consid proper that an altogeth differ depart of the govern should be permit to do so some of our best polit maxim and opinion have been drawn from our parent isl there are other howev which can not be introduc in our system without singular incongru and the product of much mischief and thi i conceiv to be one no matter in which of the hous of parliament a bill may origin nor by whom introduc a minist or a member of the opposit by the fiction of law or rather of constitut principl the sovereign is suppos to have prepar it agreeabl to hi will and then submit it to parliament for their advic and consent now the veri revers is the case here not onli with regard to the principl but the form prescrib by the constitut the principl certainli assign to the onli bodi constitut by the constitut the legisl bodi the power to make law and the form even direct that the enact should be ascrib to them the senat in relat to revenu bill have the right to propos amend and so ha the execut by the power given him to return them to the hous of repres with hi object it is in hi power also to propos amend in the exist revenu law suggest by hi observ upon their defect or injuri oper but the delic duti of devis scheme of revenu should be left where the constitut ha place it with the immedi repres of the peopl for similar reason the mode of keep the public treasur should be prescrib by them and the further remov it may be from the control of the execut the more wholesom the arrang and the more in accord with republican principl connect with thi subject is the charact of the currenc the idea of make it exclus metal howev well intend appear to me to be fraught with more fatal consequ than ani other scheme have no relat to the person right of the citizen that ha ever been devis if ani singl scheme could produc the effect of arrest at onc that mutat of condit by which thousand of our most indig fellow citizen by their industri and enterpris are rais to the possess of wealth that is the one if there is one measur better calcul than anoth to produc that state of thing so much deprec by all true republican by which the rich are daili ad to their hoard and the poor sink deeper into penuri it is an exclus metal currenc or if there is a process by which the charact of the countri for generos and nobl of feel may be destroy by the great increas and neck toler of usuri it is an exclus metal currenc amongst the other duti of a delic charact which the presid is call upon to perform is the supervis of the govern of the territori of the unit state those of them which are destin to becom member of our great polit famili are compens by their rapid progress from infanc to manhood for the partial and temporari depriv of their polit right it is in thi district onli where american citizen are to be found who under a settl polici are depriv of mani import polit privileg without ani inspir hope as to the futur their onli consol under circumst of such depriv is that of the devot exterior guard of a camp that their suffer secur tranquil and safeti within are there ani of their countrymen who would subject them to greater sacrific to ani other humili than those essenti necessari to the secur of the object for which they were thu separ from their fellow citizen are their right alon not to be guarante by the applic of those great principl upon which all our constitut are found we are told by the greatest of british orat and statesmen that at the commenc of the war of the revolut the most stupid men in england spoke of their american subject are there inde citizen of ani of our state who have dream of their subject in the district of columbia such dream can never be realiz by ani agenc of mine the peopl of the district of columbia are not the subject of the peopl of the state but free american citizen be in the latter condit when the constitut wa form no word use in that instrument could have been intend to depriv them of that charact if there is anyth in the great principl of unalien right so emphat insist upon in our declar of independ they could neither make nor the unit state accept a surrend of their liberti and becom the subject in other word the slave of their former fellow citizen if thi be true and it will scarc be deni by anyon who ha a correct idea of hi own right as an american citizen the grant to congress of exclus jurisdict in the district of columbia can be interpret so far as respect the aggreg peopl of the unit state as mean noth more than to allow to congress the control power necessari to afford a free and safe exercis of the function assign to the gener govern by the constitut in all other respect the legisl of congress should be adapt to their peculiar posit and want and be conform with their deliber opinion of their own interest i have spoken of the necess of keep the respect depart of the govern as well as all the other author of our countri within their appropri orbit thi is a matter of difficulti in some case as the power which they respect claim are often not defin by ani distinct line mischiev howev in their tendenc as collis of thi kind may be those which aris between the respect commun which for certain purpos compos one nation are much more so for no such nation can long exist without the care cultur of those feel of confid and affect which are the effect bond to union between free and confeder state strong as is the tie of interest it ha been often found ineffectu men blind by their passion have been known to adopt measur for their countri in direct opposit to all the suggest of polici the altern then is to destroy or keep down a bad passion by creat and foster a good one and thi seem to be the corner stone upon which our american polit architect have rear the fabric of our govern the cement which wa to bind it and perpetu it exist wa the affection attach between all it member to insur the continu of thi feel produc at first by a commun of danger of suffer and of interest the advantag of each were made access to all no particip in ani good possess by ani member of our extens confederaci except in domest

of the whole the line too separ power to be exercis by the citizen of one state from those of anoth seem to be so distinctli drawn as to leav no room for misunderstand the citizen of each state unit in their person all the privileg which that charact confer and all that they may claim as citizen of the unit state but in no case can the same person at the same time act as the citizen of two separ

as to their manag and the form in which it is tender is left to hi own discret and sens of proprieti it may be observ howev that organ associ of citizen requir complianc with their wish too much resembl the recommend of athen to her alli support by an arm and power fleet it wa inde to the ambit of the lead state of greec to control the domest concern of the other that the destruct of that

with these view of the natur charact and object of the govern and the valu of the union i shall steadili oppos the creation of those institut and system which in their natur tend to pervert it from it legitim purpos and make it the instrument of section class and individu we need no nation bank or other extran institut plant around the govern to control or strengthen it in opposit to the will of it author experi ha taught us how unnecessari they are as auxiliari of the public author how impot for good and how power for mischief our wa intend to be a plain and frugal govern and i shall regard it to be my duti to recommend to congress and as far as the execut is concern to enforc by all the mean within my power the strictest economi in the expenditur of the public money which may be compat with the public interest a nation debt ha becom almost an institut of european monarchi it is view in some of them as an essenti prop to exist govern melancholi is the condit of that peopl whose

doubt that the debt which ha grown out of the circumst of the last few year may be speedili paid off i congratul my fellow citizen on the entir restor of the credit of the gener govern of the union and that of mani of the state happi would it be for the indebt state if they were freed from their liabil mani of which were incauti contract although the govern of the union is neither in a legal nor a moral sens bound for the debt of the state and it would be a violat of our compact of union to assum them yet we can not but feel a deep interest in see all the state meet their public liabil and pay off their just debt at the earliest practic period that they will do so as soon as it can be done without impos too heavi burden on their citizen there is no reason to doubt the sound moral and honor feel of the peopl of the indebt state can not be question and we are happi to perceiv a settl disposit on their part as their abil return after a season of unexampl pecuniari embarrass to pay off all just demand and to acquiesc in ani reason measur to accomplish that object one of the difficulti which we have had to encount in the practic administr of the govern consist in the adjust of our revenu law and the levi of the tax necessari for the support of govern in the gener proposit that no more money shall be collect than the necess of an econom administr shall requir all parti seem to acquiesc nor doe there seem to be ani materi differ of opinion as to the absenc of right in the govern to tax one section of countri or one class of citizen or one occup for the mere profit of anoth justic and sound polici forbid the feder govern to foster one branch of industri to the detriment of anoth or to cherish the interest of one portion to the injuri of anoth portion of our common

fair and just protect to all of the great interest of the whole union embrac agricultur manufactur the mechan art commerc and navig i have also declar my opinion to be in favor of a tariff for revenu and that in adjust the detail of such a tariff i have sanction such moder discrimin duti as would produc the amount of revenu need and at the same time afford reason incident protect to our home industri and that i wa oppos to a tariff for protect mere and not for revenu the power to lay and collect tax duti impost and excis wa an indispens one to be confer on the feder govern which without

discrimin within the revenu principl as will afford incident protect to our home interest within the revenu limit there is a discret to discrimin beyond that limit the right exercis of the power is not conced the incident protect afford to our home interest by discrimin within the revenu rang it is believ will be ampl in make discrimin all our home interest should as far as practic be equal protect the largest portion of our peopl are agriculturist other are employ in manufactur commerc navig and the mechan art they are all engag in their respect pursuit and their joint labor constitut the nation or home industri to tax one branch of thi home industri for the benefit of anoth would be unjust no one of these interest can right claim an advantag over the other or to be enrich by impoverish the other all are equal entitl to the foster care and protect of the govern in exercis a sound discret in levi discrimin duti within the limit prescrib care should be taken that it be done in a manner not to benefit the wealthi few at the expens of the toil million by tax lowest the luxuri of life or articl of superior qualiti and high price which can onli be consum by the wealthi and highest the necessari of life or articl of coars qualiti and low price which the poor and great mass of our peopl must consum the burden of govern should as far as practic be distribut justli and equal among all class of our popul these gener view long entertain on thi subject i have deem it proper to reiter it is a subject upon which conflict interest of section and occup are suppos to exist and a spirit of mutual concess and compromis in adjust it detail should be cherish by everi part of our widespread countri as the onli mean of preserv harmoni and a cheer acquiesc of all in the oper of our revenu law our patriot citizen in everi part of the union will readili submit to the payment of such tax as shall be need for the support of their govern whether in peac or in war if they are

power compet to contract and foreign nation have no right to interfer with them or to take except to their reunion foreign power do not seem to appreci the true charact of our govern our union is confeder of independ state whose polici is peac with each other and all the world to enlarg it limit is to extend the dominion of peac over addit territori and increas million the world ha noth to fear from militari ambit in our govern while the chief magistr and the popular branch of congress are elect for short term by the suffrag of those million who must in their own person bear all the burden and miseri of war our govern can not be otherwis than pacif foreign power should therefor look on the annex of texa to the unit state not as the conquest of a nation seek to extend her dominion

exhibit so grand and strike a spectacl of the capac of man for self govern what a happi concept then wa it for congress to appli thi simpl rule that the will of the major shall govern to the

to form and regul their domest institut in their own way subject onli to the constitut of the unit state as a natur consequ congress ha also prescrib that when the territori of kansa shall be admit as a state it shall be receiv into the union with or without slaveri as their constitut may prescrib at the time of their admiss a differ of opinion ha arisen in regard to the point of time when the peopl of a territori shall decid thi question for themselv thi is happili a matter of but littl practic import besid it is a judici question which legitim belong to the suprem court of the unit state

opinion that under the nebraska kansa act the appropri period will be when the number of actual resid in the territori shall justifi the format of a constitut with a view to it admiss as a state into

not then hope that the long agit on thi subject is approach it end and that the geograph parti to which it ha given birth so much dread by the father of hi countri will speedili becom extinct most happi will it be for the countri when the public mind shall be divert from thi question to other of more press and practic import throughout the whole progress of thi agit which ha scarc known ani

evil in the sound sens and sober judgment of the peopl time is a great correct polit subject which but a few year ago excit and exasper the public mind have pass away and are now nearli forgotten but thi question of domest slaveri is of far graver import than ani mere polit question becaus should the agit continu it may eventu endang the person safeti of a larg portion of our countrymen where the

man therefor exert hi best influenc to suppress thi agit which sinc the recent legisl of congress is without ani legitim object it is an evil omen of the time that men have undertaken to calcul the mere materi valu of the union reason estim have been present of the pecuniari profit and local advantag which would result to differ state and section from it dissolut and of the compar injuri which such an event would inflict on other state and section even descend to thi low and narrow view of the mighti question all such calcul are at fault the bare refer to a singl consider will be conclus on thi point we at present enjoy a free trade throughout our extens and expand countri such as the world ha never wit thi trade is conduct on railroad and canal on nobl river and arm of the sea which bind togeth the north and the south the east and the west of our confederaci annihil thi trade arrest it free progress by the geograph line of jealou and hostil state and you destroy the prosper and

from disunion to everi portion of the confederaci to the north not more than to the south to the east not more than to the west these i shall not attempt to portray becaus i feel an humbl confid that the kind provid which inspir our father with wisdom to frame the most perfect form of govern and union ever devis by man will not suffer it to perish until it shall have been peac instrument by it exampl in the extens of civil and religi liberti throughout the world next in import to the mainten of the constitut and the union is the duti of preserv the govern free from the taint or even the suspicion of corrupt public virtu is the vital spirit of republ and histori prove that when thi ha decay and the love of money ha usurp it place although the form of free govern may remain for a

whether right or wrong is suspect and the charact of the govern suffer in the estim of the peopl thi is in itself a veri great evil the natur mode of relief from thi embarrass is to appropri the surplu in the treasuri to great nation object for which a clear warrant can be found in the constitut among these i might mention the extinguish of the public debt a reason increas of the navi which is at present inadequ to the protect of our vast tonnag afloat now greater than that of ani other nation as well as to the defens of our extend seacoast it is beyond all question the true principl that no more revenu ought to be collect from the peopl than the amount necessari to defray the expens of a wise econom and effici administr of the govern to reach thi point it wa necessari to resort to a modif of the tariff and thi ha i trust been accomplish in such a manner as to do as littl injuri as may have been practic to our domest manufactur especi those necessari for the defens of the countri ani discrimin against a particular branch for the purpos of benefit favor corpor individu or interest would have been unjust to the rest of the commun and inconsist with that spirit of fair

land no nation in the tide of time ha ever been bless with so rich and nobl an inherit as we enjoy in the public land in administ thi import trust whilst it may be wise to grant portion of them for

exil from foreign shore who may seek in thi countri to improv their condit and to enjoy the bless of civil and religi liberti such emigr have done much to promot the growth and prosper of the countri they have prove faith both in peac and in war after becom citizen they are entitl under the constitut and law to be place on a perfect equal with nativ born citizen and in thi charact they should ever be kindli recogn the feder constitut is a grant from the state to congress of certain specif power and the question whether thi grant should be liber or strictli constru ha more or less divid polit parti from the begin without enter into the argument i desir to state at the commenc of my administr that long experi and observ have convinc me that a strict construct of the power of the govern i the onli true as well as the onli safe theori of the constitut whenev in our past histori doubt power have been exercis by congress these have never fail to produc injuri and unhappi consequ mani such instanc might be adduc if thi were the proper occas neither is it necessari for the public servic to strain the languag of the constitut becaus all the great and use power requir for a success administr of the govern both in peac and in war have been grant either in express term or by the plainest implic whilst deepli convinc of these truth i yet consid it clear that under the war make power congress may appropri money toward the construct of a militari road when thi is absolut necessari for the defens of ani state or territori of the union against foreign invas under the constitut congress ha power to declar war to rais and support armi to provid and maintain a navi and to call forth the militia to repel invas thu endow in an ampl manner with the war make power the correspond duti is requir that the unit state shall protect each of them the state against invas now how is it possibl to afford thi protect to california and our pacif possess except by mean of a militari road through the territori of the unit state over which men and munit of war may be speedili transport from the atlant state to meet and to repel the invad in the event of a war with a naval power much stronger than our own we should then have no other avail access to the pacif coast becaus such a power would instantli close the rout across the isthmu of central america it is imposs to conceiv that whilst the constitut ha expressli requir congress to defend all the state it should yet deni to them by ani fair construct the onli possibl mean by which one of these state can be defend besid the govern ever sinc it origin ha been in the constant practic of construct militari road it might also be wise to consid whether the love for the union which now anim our fellow citizen on the pacif coast may not be impair by our neglect or refus to provid for them in their remot and isol condit the onli mean by which the power of the state on thi side of the rocki mountain can reach them in suffici time to protect them against invas i forbear for the present from express an opinion as to the wisest and most econom mode in which the govern can lend it aid in accomplish thi great and necessari work i believ that mani of the difficulti in the way which now appear formid will in a great degre vanish as soon as the nearest and best rout shall have been satisfactorili ascertain it may be proper that on thi occas i should make some brief remark in regard to our right and duti as a member of the great famili of nation in our intercours with them there are some plain principl approv by our own experi from which we should never depart we ought to cultiv peac commerc and friendship with all nation and thi not mere as the best mean of promot our own materi interest but in a spirit of christian benevol toward our fellow men wherev their lot may be cast our diplomaci should be direct and frank neither seek to obtain more nor accept less than is our due we ought to cherish a sacr regard for the independ of all nation and never attempt to interfer in the domest concern of ani unless thi shall be imper requir by the great law of self preserv to avoid entangl allianc ha been a maxim of our polici ever sinc the day of washington and it wisdom no one will attempt to disput in short we ought to do justic in a kindli spirit to all nation and requir justic from them in return it

under the treati of peac for a sum which wa consid at the time a fair equival our past histori forbid that we shall in the futur acquir territori unless thi be sanction by the law of justic and honor act on thi principl no nation will have a right to interfer or to complain if in the progress of event we shall still further extend our possess hitherto in all our acquisit the peopl under the

there ha never been ani reason caus for such apprehens inde the most ampl evid to the contrari ha all the while exist and been open to their inspect it is found in nearli all the publish speech of him who now address you i do but quot from one of those speech when i declar that i have no purpos directli or indirectli to interfer with the institut of slaveri in the state where it exist i believ i have no law right to do so and i have no inclin to do so those who nomin and elect me did so with full knowledg that i had made thi and mani similar declar and had never recant them and more than thi they place in the platform for my accept and as a law to themselv and to me the clear and emphat resolut which i now read resolv that the mainten inviol of the right of the state and especi the right of each state to order and control it own domest institut accord to it own judgment exclus is essenti to that balanc of power on which the perfect and endur of our polit fabric depend and we denounc the lawless invas by arm forc of the soil of ani state or territori no matter what pretext as among the gravest of crime i now reiter these sentiment and in do so i onli press upon the public attent the most conclus evid of which the case is suscept that the properti peac and secur of no section are to be in ani wise endang by the now incom administr i add too that all the protect which consist with the constitut and the law can be given will be cheer given to all the state when law demand for whatev caus as cheer to one section as to anoth there is much controversi about the deliv up of fugit from servic or labor the claus i now read is as plainli written in the constitut as ani other of it provis no person held to servic or labor in one state under the law thereof escap into anoth shall in consequ of ani law or regul therein be discharg from such servic or labor but shall be deliv up on claim of the parti to whom such servic or labor may be due it is scarc question that thi provis wa intend by those who made it for the reclaim of what we call fugit slave and the intent of the lawgiv is the law all member of congress swear their support to the whole constitut to thi provis as much as to ani other to the proposit then that slave whose case come within the term of thi claus shall be deliv up their oath are unanim now if they would make the effort in good temper could they not with nearli equal unanim frame and pass a law by mean of which to keep good that unanim oath there is some differ of opinion whether thi claus should be enforc by nation or by state author but sure that differ is not a veri materi one if the slave is to be surrend it can be of but littl consequ to him or to other by which author it is done and should anyon in ani case be content that hi oath shall go unkept on a mere unsubstanti controversi as to how it shall be kept again in ani law upon thi subject ought not all the safeguard of liberti known in civil and human jurisprud to be introduc so that a free man be not in ani case surrend as a slave and might it not be well at the same time to provid by law for the enforc of that claus in the constitut which guarante that the citizen of each state shall be entitl to all privileg and immun of citizen in the sever state i take the offici oath to day with no mental reserv and with no purpos to constru the constitut or law by ani hypercrit rule and while i do not choos now to specifi particular act of congress as proper to be enforc i do suggest that it will be much safer for all both in offici and privat station to conform to and abid by all those act which stand unrep than to violat ani of them trust to find impun in have them held to be unconstitut it is seventi two year sinc the first inaugur of a presid under our nation constitut dure that period fifteen differ and greatli distinguish citizen have in success administ the execut branch of the govern they have conduct it through mani peril and gener with great success yet with all thi scope of preced i now enter upon the same task for the brief constitut term of four year under great and peculiar difficulti a disrupt of the feder union heretofor onli menac is now formid attempt i hold that in contempl of univers law and of the constitut the union of these state is perpetu perpetu is impli if not express in the fundament law of all nation govern it is safe to assert that no govern proper ever had a provis in it organ law for it own termin continu to execut all the express provis of our nation constitut and the union will endur forev it be imposs to destroy it except by some action not provid for in the instrument itself again if the unit state be not a govern proper but an associ of state in the natur of contract mere can it as a contract be peaceabl unmad by less than all the parti who made it one parti to a contract may violat it break it so to speak but doe it not requir all to law rescind it descend from these gener principl we find the proposit that in legal contempl the union is perpetu confirm by the histori of the union itself the union is much older than the constitut it wa form in fact by the articl of associ in 1774 it wa matur and continu by the declar of independ in 1776 it wa further matur and the faith of all the then thirteen state expressli plight and engag that it should be perpetu by the articl of confeder in 1778 and final in 1787 one of the declar object for ordain and establish the constitut wa to form a more perfect union but if destruct of the union by one or by a part onli of the state be law possibl the union is less perfect than befor the constitut have lost the vital element of perpetu it follow from these view that no state upon it own mere motion can law get out of the union that resolv and ordin to that effect are legal void and that act of violenc within ani state or state against the author of the unit state are insurrectionari or revolutionari accord to circumst i therefor consid that in view of the constitut and the law the union is unbroken and to the extent of my abil i shall take care as the constitut itself expressli enjoin upon me that the law of the union be faith execut in all the state do thi i deem to be onli a simpl duti on my part and i shall perform it so far as practic unless my right master the american peopl shall withhold the requisit mean or in some authorit manner direct the contrari i trust thi will not be regard as a menac but onli as the declar purpos of the union that it will constitut defend and maintain itself in do thi there need to be no bloodsh or violenc and there shall be none unless it be forc upon the nation author the power confid to me will be use to hold occupi and possess the properti and place belong to the govern and to collect the duti and impost but beyond what may be necessari for these object there will be no invas no use of forc against or among the peopl anywher where hostil to the unit state in ani interior local shall be so great and univers as to prevent compet resid citizen from hold the feder offic there will be no attempt to forc obnoxi stranger among the peopl for that object while the strict legal right may exist in the govern to enforc the exercis of these offic the attempt to do so would be so irrit and so nearli impractic withal that i deem it better to forego for the time the use of such offic the mail unless repel will continu to be furnish in all part of the union so far as possibl the peopl everywher shall have that sens of perfect secur which is most favor to calm thought and reflect the cours here indic will be follow unless current event and experi shall show a modif or chang to be proper and in everi case and exig my best discret will be exercis accord to circumst actual exist and with a view and a hope of a peac solut of the nation troubl and the restor of fratern sympathi and affect that there are person in one section or anoth who seek to destroy the union at all event and are glad of ani pretext to do it i will neither affirm nor deni but if there be such i need address no word to them to those howev who realli love the union may i not speak befor enter upon so grave a matter as the destruct of our nation fabric with all it benefit it memori and it hope would it not be wise to ascertain precis whi we do it will you hazard so desper a step while there is ani possibl that ani portion of the ill you fli from have no real exist will you while the certain ill you fli to are greater than all the real one you fli from will you risk the commiss of so fear a mistak all profess to be content in the union if all constitut right can be maintain is it true then that ani right plainli written in the constitut ha been deni i

if by the mere forc of number a major should depriv a minor of ani clearli written constitut right it might in a moral point of view justifi revolut certainli would if such right were a vital one but such is not our case all the vital right of minor and of individu are so plainli assur to them by affirm and negat guaranti and prohibit in the constitut that controversi never aris concern them but

the minor will not acquiesc the major must or the govern must ceas there is no other altern for continu the govern is acquiesc on one side or the other if a minor in such case will seced rather than acquiesc they make a preced which in turn will divid and ruin them for a minor of their own will seced from them whenev a major refus to be control by such minor for instanc whi may not ani portion of a new confederaci a year or two henc arbitrarili seced again precis as portion of the present union now claim to seced from it all who cherish disunion sentiment are now be educ to the exact temper of do thi is there such perfect ident of interest among the state to compos a new union as to produc harmoni onli and prevent renew secess plainli the central idea of secess is the essenc of anarchi a major held in restraint by constitut check and limit and alway chang easili with deliber chang of popular opinion and sentiment is the onli true sovereign of a free peopl whoever reject it doe of necess fli to anarchi or to despot unanim is imposs the rule of a minor as a perman arrang is wholli inadmiss so that reject the major principl anarchi or despot in some form is all that is left i do not forget the posit assum by some that constitut question are to be decid by the suprem court nor do i deni that such decis must be bind in ani case upon the parti to a suit as to the object of that suit while they are also entitl to veri high respect and consider in all parallel case by all other depart of the govern and while it is obvious possibl that such decis may be erron in ani given case still the evil effect follow it be limit to that particular case with the chanc that it may be overrul and never becom a preced for other case can better be born than could the evil of a differ practic at the same time the candid citizen must confess that if the polici of the govern upon vital question affect the whole peopl is to be irrevoc fix by decis of the suprem court the instant they are made in ordinari litig between parti in person action the peopl will have ceas to be their own ruler have to that extent practic resign their govern into the hand of that emin tribun nor is there in thi view ani assault upon the court or the judg it is a duti from which they may not shrink to decid case properli brought befor them and it is no fault of their if other seek to turn their decis to polit purpos one section of our countri believ slaveri is right and ought to be extend while the other believ it is wrong and ought not to be extend thi is the onli substanti disput the fugit slave claus of the constitut and the law for the suppress of the foreign slave trade are each as well enforc perhap as ani law can ever be in a commun where the moral sens of the peopl imperfectli support the law itself the great bodi of the peopl abid by the dri legal oblig in both case and a few break over in each thi i think can not be perfectli cure and it would be wors in both case after the separ of the section than befor the foreign slave trade now imperfectli suppress would be ultim reviv without restrict in one section while fugit slave now onli partial surrend would not be surrend at all by the other physic speak we can not separ we can not remov our respect section from each other nor build an impass wall between them a husband and wife may be divorc and go out of the presenc and beyond the reach of each other but the differ part of our countri can not do thi they can not but remain face to face and intercours either amic or hostil must continu between them is it possibl then

truth of thi alleg is admit it is answer that in mani place honest local govern is imposs if the mass of uneduc negro are allow to vote these are grave alleg so far as the latter is true it is the onli palliat that can be offer for oppos the freedom of the ballot bad local govern is certainli a great evil which ought to be prevent but to violat the freedom and sanctiti of the suffrag is more than an evil it is a crime which if persist in will destroy the govern itself suicid is not a remedi if in other land it be high treason to compass the death of the king it shall be count no less a crime here to strangl our sovereign power and stifl it voic it ha been said that unsettl question have no piti for the repos of nation it should be said with the utmost emphasi that thi question of the suffrag will never give repos or safeti to the state or to the nation until each within it own jurisdict make and keep the ballot free and pure by the strong sanction of the law but the danger which aris from ignor in the voter can not be deni it cover a field far wider than that of negro suffrag and the present condit of the race it is a danger that lurk and hide in the sourc and fountain

danger high the tide of illiteraci ha risen among our voter and their children to the south thi question is of suprem import but the respons for the exist of slaveri did not rest upon the south alon the nation itself is respons for the extens of the suffrag and is under special oblig to aid in remov the illiteraci which it ha ad to the vote popul for the north and south alik there is but one

of the wisdom of the propos chang we must be both sure we are right and make hast slowli if therefor congress in it wisdom shall deem it expedi to creat a commiss to take under earli consider the

my purpos to appoint a commiss of promin well inform citizen of differ parti who will command public confid both on account of their abil and special fit for the work busi experi and public train may thu be combin and the patriot zeal of the friend of the countri be so direct that such a report will be made as to receiv the support of all parti and our financ ceas to be the subject of mere partisan content the experi is at all event worth a trial and in my opinion it can but prove benefici to the entir countri the question of intern bimetal will have earli and earnest attent it will be my constant endeavor to secur it by co oper with the other great commerci power of the world until that condit is realiz when the pariti between our gold and silver money spring from and is support by the rel valu of the two metal the valu of the silver alreadi coin and of that which may hereaft be coin must be kept constantli at par with gold by everi resourc at our command the credit of the govern the integr of it currenc and the inviol of it oblig must be preserv thi wa the command verdict of the peopl and it will not be unheed economi is demand in everi branch of the govern at all time but especi in period like the present of depress in busi and distress among the peopl the severest economi must be observ in all public expenditur and extravag stop wherev it is found and prevent wherev in the futur it may be develop if the revenu are to remain as now the onli relief that can come must be from decreas expenditur but the present must not becom the perman condit of the govern it ha been our uniform practic to retir not increas our outstand oblig and thi polici must again be resum and vigor enforc our revenu should alway be larg enough to meet with eas and prompt not onli our current need and the princip and interest of the public debt but to make proper and liber provis for that most deserv bodi of public creditor the soldier and sailor and the widow and orphan who are the pension of the unit state the govern should not be permit to run behind or increas it debt in time like the present suitabl to provid against thi is the mandat of duti the certain and easi remedi for most of our financi difficulti a defici is inevit so long as the expenditur of the govern exceed it receipt it can onli be met by loan or an increas revenu while a larg annual surplu of revenu may invit wast and extravag inadequ revenu creat distrust and undermin public and privat credit neither should be encourag between more loan and more revenu there ought to be but one opinion we should have more revenu and that without delay hindranc or postpon a surplu in the treasuri creat by loan is not a perman or safe relianc it will suffic while it last but it can not last long while the outlay of the govern are greater than it receipt as ha been the case dure the past two year nor must it be forgotten that howev much such loan may temporarili reliev the situat the govern is still indebt for the amount of the surplu thu accru which it must ultim pay while it abil to pay is not strengthen but weaken by a continu deficit loan are imper in great emerg to preserv the govern or it credit but a failur to suppli need revenu in time of peac for the mainten of either ha no justif the best way for the govern to maintain it credit is to pay as it goe not by resort to loan but by keep out of debt through an adequ incom secur by a system of taxat extern or intern or both it is the settl polici of the govern pursu from the begin and practic by all parti and administr to rais the bulk of our revenu from tax upon foreign product enter the unit state for sale and consumpt and avoid for the most part everi form of direct taxat except in time of war the countri is clearli oppos to ani needless addit to the subject of intern taxat and is commit by it latest popular utter to the system of tariff taxat there can be no misunderstand either about the principl upon which thi tariff taxat shall be levi noth ha ever been made plainer at a gener elect than that the control principl in the rais of revenu from duti on import is zealou care for american interest and american labor the peopl have declar that such legisl should be had as will give ampl protect and encourag to the industri and the develop of our countri it is therefor earnestli hope and expect that congress will at the earliest practic moment enact revenu legisl that shall be fair reason conserv and just and which while suppli suffici revenu for public purpos will still be signal benefici and help to everi section and everi enterpris of the peopl to thi polici we are all of whatev parti firmli bound by the voic of the peopl a power vastli more potenti than the express of ani polit platform the paramount duti of congress is to stop defici by the restor of that protect legisl which ha alway been the firmest prop of the treasuri the passag of such a law or law would strengthen the credit of the govern both at home and abroad and go far toward stop the drain upon the gold reserv held for the redempt of our currenc which ha been heavi and well nigh constant for sever year in the revis of the tariff especi attent should be given to the re enact and extens of the reciproc principl of the law of 1890 under which so great a stimulu wa given to our foreign trade in new and advantag market for our surplu

of new market for the product of our countri by grant concess to the product of other land that we need and can not produc ourselv and which do not involv ani loss of labor to our own peopl but tend to increas their employ the depress of the past four year ha fallen with especi sever upon the great bodi of toiler of the countri and upon none more than the holder of small farm agricultur ha languish and labor suffer the reviv of manufactur will be a relief to both no portion of our popul is more devot to the institut of free govern nor more loyal in their support while none bear more

of congress than upon ani other singl agenc affect the situat it is inspir too to rememb that no great emerg in the one hundr and eight year of our event nation life ha ever arisen that ha not been

of such new statut as may be necessari to carri it into effect our natur and immigr law should be further improv to the constant promot of a safer a better and a higher citizenship a grave peril to the republ would be a citizenship too ignor to understand or too viciou to appreci the great valu and benefic of our institut and law and against all who come here to make war upon them our gate must

should be real and genuin not perfunctori or prompt by a zeal in behalf of ani parti simpli becaus it happen to be in power as a member of congress i vote and spoke in favor of the present law and i shall attempt it enforc in the spirit in which it wa enact the purpos in view wa to secur the most effici servic of the best men who would accept appoint under the govern retain faith and devot public

and whenev it ha been thu administr congress should give prompt attent to the restor of our american merchant marin onc the pride of the sea in all the great ocean highway of commerc to my mind few more import subject so imper demand it intellig consider the unit state ha progress with marvel rapid in everi field of enterpris and endeavor until we have becom foremost in nearli all the great line of inland trade commerc and industri yet while thi is true our american merchant marin ha been steadili declin until it is now lower both in the percentag of tonnag and the number of vessel employ than it wa prior to the civil war commend progress ha been made of late year in the upbuild of the american navi but we must supplement these effort by provid as a proper consort for it a merchant marin ampli suffici for our own carri trade to foreign countri the question is one that appeal both to our busi necess and the patriot aspir of a great peopl it ha been the polici of the unit state sinc the foundat of the govern to cultiv relat of peac and amiti with all the nation of the world and thi accord with my concept of our duti now we have cherish the polici of non interfer with affair of foreign govern wise inaugur by washington keep ourselv free from entangl either as alli or foe content to leav undisturb with them the settlement of their own domest concern it will be our aim to pursu a firm and dignifi foreign polici which shall be just imparti ever watch of our nation honor and alway insist upon the enforc of the law right of american citizen everywher our diplomaci should seek noth more and accept noth less than is due us we want no war of conquest we must avoid the temptat of territori aggress war should never be enter upon until everi agenc of peac ha fail peac is prefer to war in almost everi conting arbitr is the true method of settlement of intern as well as local or individu differ it wa recogn as the best mean of adjust of differ between employ and employe by the forti ninth congress in 1886 and it applic wa extend to our diplomat relat by the unanim concurr of the senat and hous of the fifti first congress in 1890 the latter resolut wa accept as the basi of negoti with us by the british hous of common in 1893 and upon our invit a treati of arbitr between the unit state and great britain wa sign at washington and transmit to the senat for it ratif in januari last sinc thi treati is clearli the result of our own initi sinc it ha been recogn as the lead featur of our foreign polici throughout our entir histori the adjust of difficulti by judici method rather than forc of arm and sinc it present to the world the gloriou exampl of reason and peac not passion and war control the relat between two of the greatest nation in the world an exampl certain to be follow by other i respect urg the earli action of the senat thereon not mere as a matter of polici but as a duti to mankind the import and moral influenc of the ratif of such a treati can hardli be overestim in the caus of advanc civil it may well engag the best thought of the statesmen and peopl of everi countri and i can not but consid it fortun that it wa reserv to the unit state to have the leadership in so grand a work it ha been the uniform practic of each presid to avoid as far as possibl the conven of congress in extraordinari session it is an exampl which under ordinari circumst and in the absenc of a public necess is to be commend but a failur to conven the repres of the peopl in congress in extra session when it involv neglect of a public duti place the respons of such neglect upon the execut himself the condit of the public treasuri as ha been indic demand the immedi consider of congress it alon ha the power to provid revenu for the govern not to conven it under such circumst i can view in no other sens than the neglect of a plain duti i do not sympath with the sentiment that congress in session is danger to our gener busi interest it member are the agent of the peopl and their presenc at the seat of govern in the execut of the sovereign will should not oper as an injuri but a benefit there could be no better time to put the govern upon a sound financi and econom basi than now the peopl have onli recent vote that thi should be done and noth is more bind upon the agent of their will than the oblig of immedi action it ha alway seem to me that the postpon of the meet of congress until more than a year after it ha been chosen depriv congress too often of the inspir of the popular will and the countri of the correspond benefit it is evid therefor that to postpon action in the presenc of so great a necess would be unwis on the part of the execut becaus unjust to the interest of the peopl our action now will be freer from mere partisan consider than if the question of tariff revis wa postpon until the regular session of congress we are nearli two year from a congression elect and polit can not so greatli distract us as if such contest wa immedi pend we can approach the problem calmli and patriot without fear it effect upon an earli elect our fellow citizen who may disagre with us upon the charact of thi legisl prefer to have the question settl now even against their preconceiv view and perhap settl so reason as i trust and believ it will be as to insur great perman than to have further uncertainti menac the vast and vari busi interest of the unit state again whatev action congress may take will be given a fair opportun for trial befor the peopl are call to pass judgment upon it and thi i consid a great essenti to

most import it disturb the whole busi of the countri it is imper necessari therefor that a tariff bill be drawn in good faith in accord with promis made befor the elect by the parti in power and as promptli pass as due consider will permit it is not that the tariff is more import in the long run than the perfect of the reform in respect to antitrust legisl and interst commerc regul but the need for action when the revis of the tariff ha been determin upon is more immedi to avoid embarrass of busi to secur the need speed in the passag of the tariff bill it would seem wise to attempt no other legisl at the extra session i ventur thi as a suggest onli for the cours to be taken by congress upon the call of the execut is wholli within it discret in the mail of a tariff bill the prime motiv is taxat and the secur therebi of a revenu due larg to the busi depress which follow the financi panic of 1907 the revenu from custom and other sourc ha decreas to such an extent that the expenditur for the current fiscal year will exceed the receipt by $ 100000000 it is imper that such a deficit shall not continu and the framer of the tariff bill must of cours have in mind the total revenu like to be produc by it and so arrang the duti as to secur an adequ incom should it be imposs to do so by import duti new kind of taxat must be adopt and among these i recommend a graduat inherit tax as correct in principl and as certain and easi of collect the oblig on the part of those respons for the expenditur made to carri on the govern to be as econom as possibl and to make the burden of taxat as light as possibl is plain and should be affirm in everi declar of govern polici thi is especi true when we are face to face with a heavi deficit but when the desir to win the popular approv lead to the cut off of expenditur realli need t make the govern effect and to enabl it to accomplish it proper object the result is as much to be condemn as the wast of govern fund in unnecessari expenditur the scope of a modern govern in what it can and ought to accomplish for it peopl ha been widen far beyond the principl laid down by the old laissez fair school of polit writer and thi widen ha met

are all proper govern function which must involv larg expenditur if properli perform while some of them like the reclam of arid land are made to pay for themselv other are of such an indirect benefit that thi can not be expect of them a perman improv like the panama canal should be treat as a distinct enterpris and should be paid for by the proce of bond the issu of which will distribut it cost between the present and futur gener in accord with the benefit deriv it may well be submit to the seriou consider of congress whether the deepen and control of the channel of a great river system like

will not be abl to do so howev if it is understood that she never intend to back up her assert of right and her defens of her interest by anyth but mere verbal protest and diplomat note for these reason the expens of the armi and navi and of coast defens should alway be consid as someth which the govern must pay for and they should not be cut off through mere consider of economi our govern is

southern state that is a secondari consider what i look forward to is an increas in the toler of polit view of all kind and their advocaci throughout the south and the exist of a respect polit opposit in everi state even more than thi to an increas feel on the part of all the peopl in the south that thi govern is their govern and that it offic in their state are their offic the consider of thi question can not howev be complet and full without refer to the negro race it progress and it present condit the thirteenth amend secur them freedom the fourteenth amend due process of law protect of properti and the pursuit of happi and the fifteenth amend attempt to secur the negro against ani depriv of the privileg to vote becaus he wa a negro the thirteenth and fourteenth amend have been gener enforc and have secur the object for which they are intend while the fifteenth amend ha not been gener observ in the past it ought to be observ and the tendenc of southern legisl today is toward the enact of elector qualif which shall squar with that amend of cours the mere adopt of a constitut law is onli one step in the right direct it must be fairli and justli enforc as well in time both will come henc it is clear to all that the domin of an ignor irrespons element can be prevent by constitut law which shall exclud from vote both negro and white not have educ or other qualif thought to be necessari for a proper elector the danger of the control of an ignor elector ha therefor pass with thi chang the interest which mani of the southern white citizen take in the welfar of the negro ha increas the color men must base their hope on the result of their own industri self restraint thrift and busi success as well as upon the aid and comfort and sympathi which they may receiv from their white neighbor of the south there wa a time when northern who sympath with the negro in hi necessari struggl for better condit sought to give him the suffrag as a protect to enforc it exercis against the prevail sentiment of the south the movement prove to be a failur what remain is the fifteenth amend to the constitut and the right to have statut of state specifi qualif for elector subject to the test of complianc with that amend thi is a great protect to the negro it never will be repeal and it never ought to be repeal if it had not pass it might be difficult now to adopt it but with it in our fundament law the polici of southern legisl must and will tend to obey it and so long as the statut of the state meet the test of thi amend and are not otherwis in conflict with the constitut and law of the unit state it is not the disposit or within the provinc of the feder govern to interfer with the regul by southern state of their domest affair there is in the south a stronger feel than ever among the intellig well to do and influenti element in favor of the industri educ of the negro and the encourag of the race to make themselv use member of the commun the progress which the negro ha made in the last fifti year from slaveri when it statist are review is marvel and it furnish everi reason to hope that in the next twenti five year a still greater improv in hi condit as a product member of societi on the farm and in the shop and in other occup may come the negro are now american their ancestor came here year ago against their will and thi is their onli countri and their onli

aid in the struggl they are make we are charg with the sacr duti of make their path as smooth and easi as we can ani recognit of their distinguish men ani appoint to offic from among their number is properli taken as an encourag and an appreci of their progress and thi just polici should be pursu when suitabl occas offer but it may well admit of doubt whether in the case of ani race an appoint of one of their number to a local offic in a commun in which the race feel is so widespread and acut as to interfer with the eas and facil with which the local govern busi can be done by the appointe is of suffici benefit by way of encourag to the race to outweigh the recurr and increas of race feel which such an appoint is like to engend therefor the execut in recogn the negro race by appoint must exercis a care discret not therebi to do it more harm than good on the other hand we must be care not to encourag the mere pretens of race feel manufactur in the interest of individu polit ambit person i have not the slightest race prejudic or feel and recognit of it exist onli awaken in my heart a deeper sympathi for those who have to bear it or suffer from it and i question the wisdom of a polici which is like to increas it meantim if noth is done to prevent it a better feel between the negro and the white in the south will continu to grow and more and more of the white peopl will come to realiz that the futur of the south is to be much benefit by the industri and intellectu progress of the negro the exercis of polit franchis by those of thi race who are intellig and well to do will be acquiesc in and the right to vote will be withheld onli from the ignor and irrespons of both race there is one other matter to which i shall refer it wa made the subject of great controversi dure

more determin than ever to promot peac through friendli and good will through mutual understand and mutual forbear we have never practic the polici of competit armament we have recent commit ourselv

account use and an immeasur advanc over threaten or actual warfar i am strongli in favor of continu of thi polici whenev condit are such that there is even a promis that practic and favor result might be secur in conform with the principl that a display of reason rather than a threat of forc should be the determin factor in the intercours among nation we have long advoc the peac settlement of

activ and comprehens to signifi it approv and to bear it full share of the respons of a candid and disinterest attempt at the establish of a tribun for the administr of even hand justic between nation and nation the weight of our enorm influenc must be cast upon the side of a reign not of forc but of law and trial not by battl but by reason we have never ani wish to interfer in the polit condit of ani other countri especi are we determin not to becom implic in the polit controversi of the old world with a great deal of hesit we have respond to appeal for help to maintain order protect life and properti and establish respons govern in some of the small countri of the western hemispher our privat citizen have advanc larg sum of money to assist in the necessari financ and relief of the old world we have not fail nor shall we fail to respond whenev necessari to mitig human suffer and assist in the rehabilit of distress nation these too are requir which must be met by reason of our vast power and the place we hold in the world some of the best thought of mankind ha long been seek for a formula for perman peac undoubtedli the clarif of the principl of intern law would be help and the effort of scholar to prepar such a work for adopt by the variou nation should have our sympathi and support much may be hope for from the earnest studi of those who advoc the outlaw of aggress war but all these plan and prepar these treati and coven will not of themselv be adequ one of the greatest danger to peac lie in the econom pressur to which peopl find themselv subject one of the most practic thing to be done in the world is to seek arrang under which such pressur may be remov so that opportun may be renew and hope may be reviv there must be some assur that effort and endeavor will be follow by success and prosper in the make and financ of such adjust there is not onli an opportun but a real duti for america to respond with her counsel and her resourc condit must be provid under which peopl can make a live and work out of their difficulti but there is anoth element more import than all without which there can not be the slightest hope of a perman peac that element lie in the heart of human unless the desir for peac be cherish there unless thi fundament and onli natur sourc of brotherli love be cultiv to it highest degre all artifici effort will be in vain peac will come when there is realiz that onli under a reign of law base on righteous and support by the religi convict of the brotherhood of man can there be ani hope of a complet and satisfi life parchment will fail the sword will fail it is onli the spiritu natur of man that can be triumphant it seem altogeth probabl that we can contribut most to these import object by maintain our posit of polit detach and independ we are not identifi with ani old world interest thi posit should be made more and more clear in our relat with all foreign countri we are at peac with all of them our program is never to oppress but alway to assist but while we do justic to other we must requir that justic be done to us with us a treati of peac mean peac and a treati of amiti mean amiti we have made great contribut to the settlement of contenti differ in both europ and asia but there is a veri definit point beyond which we can not go we can onli help those who help themselv mind of these limit the one great duti that stand out requir us to use our enorm power to trim the balanc of the world while we can look with a great deal of pleasur upon what we have done abroad we must rememb that our continu success in that direct depend upon what we do at home sinc it veri outset it ha been found necessari to conduct our govern by mean of polit parti that system would not have surviv from gener to gener if it had not been fundament sound and provid the best instrument for the most complet express of the popular will it is not necessari to claim that it ha alway work perfectli it is enough to know that noth better ha been devis no one would deni that there should be full and free express and an opportun for independ of action within the parti there is no salvat in a narrow and bigot partisanship but if there is to be respons parti govern the parti label must be someth more than a mere devic for secur offic unless those who are elect under the same parti design are will to assum suffici respons and exhibit suffici loyalti and coher so that they can cooper with each other in the support of the broad gener principl of the parti platform the elect is mere a mockeri no decis is made at the poll and there is no represent of the popular will common honesti and good faith with the peopl who support a parti at the poll requir that parti when it enter offic to assum the control of that portion of the govern to which it ha been elect ani other cours is bad faith and a violat of the parti pledg when the countri ha bestow it confid upon a parti by make it a major in the congress it ha a right to expect such uniti of action as will make the parti major an effect instrument of govern thi administr ha come into power with a veri clear and definit mandat from the peopl the express of the popular will in favor of maintain our constitut guarante wa overwhelm and decis there wa a manifest of such faith in the integr of the court that we can consid that issu reject for some time to come likewis the polici of public ownership of railroad and certain electr util met with unmistak defeat the peopl declar that they want their right to have not a polit but a judici determin and their independ and freedom continu and support by have the ownership and control of their properti not in the govern but in their own hand as they alway do when they have a fair chanc the peopl demonstr that they are sound and are determin to have a sound govern when we turn from what wa reject to inquir what wa accept the polici that stand out with the greatest clear is that of economi in public expenditur with reduct and reform of taxat the principl involv in thi effort is that of conserv the resourc of thi countri are almost beyond comput no mind can comprehend them but the cost of our combin govern is likewis almost beyond definit not onli those who are now make their tax return but those who meet the enhanc cost of exist in their monthli bill know by hard experi what thi great burden is and what it doe no matter what other may want these peopl want a drastic economi they are oppos to wast they know that extravag lengthen the hour and diminish the reward of their labor i favor the polici of economi not becaus i wish to save money but becaus i wish to save peopl the men and women of thi countri who toil are the one who bear the cost of the govern everi dollar that we carelessli wast mean that their life will be so much the more meager everi dollar that we prudent save mean that their life will be so much the more abund economi is ideal in it most practic form if extravag were not reflect in taxat and through taxat both directli and indirectli injuri affect the peopl it would not be of so much consequ the wisest and soundest method of solv our tax problem is through economi fortun of all the great nation thi countri is best in a posit to adopt that simpl remedi we do not ani longer need wartim revenu the collect of ani tax which are not absolut requir which do not beyond reason doubt contribut to the public welfar is onli a speci of legal larceni under thi republ the reward of industri belong to those who earn them the onli constitut tax is the tax which minist to

reduct when unless we wish to hamper the peopl in their right to earn a live we must have tax reform the method of rais revenu ought not to imped the transact of busi it ought to encourag it i am oppos to extrem high rate becaus they produc littl or no revenu becaus they are bad for the countri and final becaus they are wrong we can not financ the countri we can not improv social condit through ani system of injustic even if we attempt to inflict it upon the rich those who suffer the most harm will be the poor thi countri believ in prosper it is absurd to suppos that it is enviou of those who are alreadi prosper the wise and correct cours to follow in taxat and all other econom legisl is not to destroy those who have alreadi secur success but to creat condit under which everi one will have a better chanc to be success the verdict of the countri ha been given on thi question that verdict stand we shall do well to heed it these question involv moral issu we need not concern ourselv much about the right of properti if we will faith observ the right of person under our institut their right are suprem it is not properti but the right to hold properti both great and small which our constitut guarante all owner of properti are charg with a servic these right and duti have been reveal through the conscienc of societi to have a divin sanction the veri stabil of our societi rest upon product and conserv for individu or for govern to wast and squander their resourc is to deni these right and disregard these oblig the result of econom dissip to a nation is alway moral decay these polici of better intern understand greater economi and lower tax have contribut larg to peac and prosper industri relat under the help influenc of restrict immigr and a protect

the battl hymn i dont mean thi to be sentiment i mean that on day like thi we rememb that we are all part of a continuum inescap connect by the tie that bind our children are watch in school throughout our great land and to them i say thank you for watch democraci big day for democraci belong to us all and freedom is like a beauti kite that can go higher and higher with the breez and to all i say no matter what your circumst or where you are you are part of thi day you are part of the life of our great nation a presid is neither princ nor pope and i dont seek a window on men soul in fact i yearn for a greater toler an easi going about each other attitud and way of life there are few clear area in which we as a societi must rise up unit and express our intoler the most obviou now is drug and when that first cocain wa smuggl in on a ship it may as well have been a deadli bacteria so much ha it hurt the bodi the soul of our countri and there is much to be done and to be said but take my word for it thi scourg will stop and so there is much to do and tomorrow the work begin i do not mistrust the futur i do not fear what is ahead for our problem are larg but our heart is larger our challeng are great but our will is greater and if our flaw are endless god love is truli boundless some see leadership as high drama and the sound of trumpet call and sometim it is that but i see histori as a book with mani page and each day we fill a page with act of hope and mean the new breez blow a page turn the stori unfold and so today a chapter begin a small and state stori of uniti

the recrimin and worn out dogma that for far too long have strangl our polit we remain a young nation but in the word of scriptur the time ha come to set asid childish thing the time ha come to

ha not been the path for the faint heart for those who prefer leisur over work or seek onli the pleasur of rich and fame rather it ha been the risk taker the doer the maker of thingssom celebr but more often men and women obscur in their labor who have carri us up the long rug path toward prosper and freedom for us they pack up their few worldli possess and travel across ocean in search of a new life for us they toil in sweatshop and settl the west endur the lash of the whip and plow the hard earth for us they fought and die in place like concord and gettysburg normandi and khe sahn time and again these men and women struggl and sacrif and work till their hand were raw so that we might live a better life they saw america as bigger than the sum of our individu ambit greater than all the differ of birth or wealth or faction thi is the journey we continu today we remain the most prosper power nation on earth our worker are no less product than when thi crisi began our mind are no less invent our good and servic no less need than they were last week or last month or last year our capac remain undiminish but our time of stand pat of protect narrow interest and put off unpleas

that our system can not toler too mani big plan their memori are short for they have forgotten what thi countri ha alreadi done what free men and women can achiev when imagin is join to common purpos and necess to courag what the cynic fail to understand is that the ground ha shift beneath them that the stale polit argument that have consum us for so long no longer appli the question we ask today is not whether our govern is too big or too small but whether it work whether it help famili find job at a decent wage care they can afford a retir that is dignifi where the answer is ye we intend to move forward where the answer is no program will end and those of us who manag the public dollar will be held to account to spend wise reform bad habit and do our busi in the light of day becaus onli then can we restor the vital trust between a peopl and their govern nor is the question befor us whether the market is a forc for good or ill it power to gener wealth and expand freedom is unmatch but thi crisi ha remind us that without a watch eye the market can spin out of control the nation can not prosper long when it favor onli the prosper the success of our economi ha alway depend not just on the size of our gross domest product but on the reach of our prosper on the abil to extend opportun to everi will heart not out of chariti but becaus it is the surest rout to our common good as for our common defens we reject as fals the choic between our safeti and our ideal our found father face with peril that we can scarc imagin draft a charter to assur the rule of law and the right of man a charter expand by the blood of gener those ideal still light the world and we will not give them up for expedi sake and so to all the other peopl and govern who are watch today from the grandest capit to the small villag where my father wa born know that america is a friend of each nation and everi man woman and child who seek a futur of peac and digniti and we are readi to lead onc more recal that earlier gener face down fascism and commun not just with missil and tank but with the sturdi allianc and endur convict they understood that our power alon can not protect us nor doe it entitl us to do

mountain they have someth to tell us just as the fallen hero who lie in arlington whisper through the age we honor them not onli becaus they are the guardian of our liberti but becaus they embodi the

can do and must do it is ultim the faith and determin of the american peopl upon which thi nation reli it is the kind to take in a stranger when the leve break the selfless of worker who would rather
